# Project #2 of 30 JS Projects Challenge

:zap: We're on to Project #2 for JS! :zap:

I created a number guessing game based off the [Mozilla Developer Javascript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash).

I've expanded the functionality of the game to include checking for non-numbers as well as ineligible numbers (numbers below 0 or above 100).

[Here's the site]). Happy viewing!
